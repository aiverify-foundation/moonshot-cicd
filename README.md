# ANNOUNCING PROJECT MOONSHOT (GA)

We are thrilled to announce the general availability version of Project Moonshot, a transformative update that redefines validation and governance of LLM-based AI applications, setting a new standard for the industry. Packed with groundbreaking enhancements, this powerful release delivers game-changing upgrades -- unlocking unmatched flexibility, efficiency, and scalability for your AI workflows. Most importantly, this version is designed for you to operationalize in your existing environment as seamlessly as possible.

We‚Äôre also excited to introduce the Process Checks (GenAI) web application, a dedicated tool aligned with the [AI Verify Testing Framework](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/what-is-ai-verify/) to help companies assess the responsible implementation of their LLM-based AI applications against 11 internationally recognised AI governance principles.

Available as a standalone Docker image, it complements Project Moonshot‚Äôs core capabilities in technical testing, while preserving the lean, modular design of both solutions.

<br/>

## üéØ Introduction

Developed and launched by the [Infocomm Media Development Authority](https://www.imda.gov.sg/resources/press-releases-factsheets-and-speeches/press-releases/2024/sg-launches-project-moonshot), [Moonshot](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/project-moonshot/) is a powerful AI safety evaluation tool designed to seamlessly integrate into CI/CD pipelines, automate safety testing, and ensure the reliability of LLM-based AI Applications. 

</br>

## üöÄ Why Moonshot

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Generative AI, ensuring the safety, reliability, and performance of LLM applications is paramount. Moonshot addresses this critical need by providing a unified platform for:
- **Benchmark Tests:** Systematically test LLM-based Applications across critical trust & safety risks using a wide array of open-source benchmark datasets and metrics, including guided workflows to implement **IMDA's Starter Kit for LLM-based App Testing**.
- **Red Team Attacks:** Proactively identify vulnerabilities and potential misuse scenarios in your LLM applications through streamlined adversarial prompting.

</br>

## ü§ñ Benefits of Integrating Moonshot into your CI/CD

- **Automation Testing:** Automate various AI safety testing whenever a new model or update is deployed 
- **Security & Compliance:** Detect potential AI risks and ensure compliance with AI governance policies before deployment, while generating logs and reports for governance and audit  
- **Streamlined Deployment:** Reducing bottlenecks and human intervention by integrating on-demand & scheduled AI safety checks directly into CI/CD 
- **Scalability, Cloud-Readiness & Extensibility:** Run multiple evaluations at scale across different cloud services and easily add new tests as AI regulations evolve 
- **Flexibility & Customizability:** Modular and plugin-based design allows dynamic running of selected tests based on governance policies while keeping the base image lightweight 
- **Cost & Resource Efficiency:** CI/CD optimization techniques like caching and parallel execution reduce compute, storage and operation cost 
- **Competitive Advantage & Business Benefits:** Automated AI safety testing allows for faster time-to-market, improves developer productivity with reduced manual safety testing, and ensures reliability with a better user experience in production

<br/>

## üîë Key Features

- **Benchmark Tests** that align with the four risk areas (i.e., _Hallucination_, _Undesirable Content_, _Data Disclosure_, and _Vulnerability to Adversarial Prompts_) as outlined in the [LLM Starter Kit for Safety Testing of LLM-Based Applications](https://www.imda.gov.sg/-/media/imda/files/about/emerging-tech-and-research/artificial-intelligence/large-language-model-starter-kit.pdf) recently released by IMDA. To understand more about the tests available, you can check out the `Test Methodology` section [here](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki).
- **Powerful Automated Red Teaming Agents** that are easily customizable to your application use case. To understand more about customizing the Red Teaming Agents for your application use case, you can check out [this guide](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Moonshot-Configurations).
- **Comprehensive Test Result** in the widely-accepted `.json` format for easy read/write. Moonshot's result files are also compatible with the [AI Verify Testing Framework](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/what-is-ai-verify/) and can be used to generate a business-ready summary report for internal compliance.
- **Fully Containerized** as a Docker Image for easy download and deployment into your CI/CD pipelines or MLOps workflow. To understand how you can deploy Moonshot into your pipelines, you can check out [this guide](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Onboarding-Guide-for-CI-CD-Deployment).
- **Native S3 Support** for easy read/write from your buckets.
- **Streamlined Experience** to run any combination of tests with just a **_single_** `moonshot run` command. To understand how you can use a simple command to run tests in Moonshot, you can check out [this guide](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Running-Moonshot-Tests).
- **Extensible & Modular Design** for easy extension and integration with your LLM-based AI applications, benchmarks, and attack techniques. To understand how you can run Moonshot tests on your LLM-based AI applications, you can check out [this guide](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Create-Custom-Connectors).

# Getting Started

Before jumping straight into the technical guides, below are some user personas that we think Moonshot will be helpful towards. Do take a moment to consider which user persona you belong to!

Alternatively, you can go straight to our [guides here](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki) to get started!

<br/>

## What is your User Persona?
### ü§ñ CI/CD Developer
If you are a CI/CD developer tasked to run safety tests on your LLM-based AI applications as part of your CI/CD workflow before production, you've come to the right place!
- Check out this [deployment guide](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Onboarding-Guide-for-CI-CD-Deployment) to understand how you can easily deploy Moonshot in any CI/CD pipelines.
- For organizations using **_AWS CodeBuild_**, you can check out this [guide](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Onboarding-Guide-for-AWS-CodeBuild-Deployment) instead.
    - If you are interested in contributing guides for other CI/CD platforms, kindly contact our Support Team at [info@aiverify.sg](mailto:info@aiverify.sg).
- There will be certain configurations required to operationalize Moonshot in your pipeline, so be sure to check out the [configuration guide here](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Moonshot-Configurations) and [user guide to run Moonshot test](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Running-Moonshot-Tests).

### üì≤ Application Owner
As an Application Owner, ensuring the safety of your LLM-based AI applications for your users will be the utmost priority. But we know that choosing the right safety tests for the right application use case can be immensely challenging -- and getting it wrong carries real reputational and even financial risks!

As such, the first batch of tests we've included are meant for testing Q&A-type applications -- if your application use case is for users to input a question and the LLM to generate an output, the tests here will be right up your alley!
- For a start, check out the `Test Methodology` section in our [Wiki here](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki) to understand the different test cases for each of the four risk areas listed below, as well as the methodology for deriving the corresponding tests:
    - [Hallucination](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Hallucination-for-Q&A)
    - [Undesirable Content](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot-cicd/wiki/Undesirable-Content-for-Q&A)
